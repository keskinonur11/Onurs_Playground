//Thread safe singleton implentation
//Since there may be an attempt to write/read/reset to settings array at the same time multiple times, we have to make a que of operations
//This q can be a serial or concurrent. Concurrent q can become a serial q at a time with the barrier flag. Thus the client doesn't need to wait in q when multiple read operations wanted
//Edit scheme > thread sanitizer
